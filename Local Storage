Local Storage

Local Storage
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage

- Very similar to session variables.
- Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.
- HTML web storage provides two objects for storing data on the client:
window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)

- Ways we could use it could be to "sign-in" or establish a username to be displayed at the top corner of a page, send
checkout info/invoice.

Follow Mozilla example to see how you can store and retrieve simple information.

- localStorage only supports strings. Use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse().
- Arrays, Associative Arrays, and objects must be stringified to store in local storage, then parsed when retrieved
